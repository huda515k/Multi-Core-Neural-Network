# Multi-Core-Neural-Network
A multi-core neural network simulator implemented in C++ using operating system concepts.  Each layer runs as a separate process, with neurons implemented as threads, demonstrating  parallel processing capabilities. Features forward/backward propagation, IPC via pipes,  and thread synchronization using mutexes and semaphores.
